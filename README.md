# EMazin Projects


This repository has two python files 'PRESS X TO START.py' and 'Tchou Tchou.py'.


PRESS X TO START project's aim was to create a remotely connected car using a Playstation 4 controller that would simply not do any accidents.

To create your own Press X to Start truck, here are the components needed and connections:
•	Raspberry Pi
•	9V battery + battery cap
•	2 gear motor
•	1kΩ resistors
•	2kΩ resistors
•	2 servo motors
•	3 ultrasonic sensors
•	Colored wires
•	1 motor drive
An additional PS4 controller is required in order to control the truck.
The circuit should be connected as shown below:

Tchou Tchou project's aim was to create a spider like mimic movement.

To create your own SpiderBOT, here are the components needed and connections:
•	Raspberry Pi
•	9V battery + battery cap
•	NPN transistor
•	1kΩ resistor
•	Diode
•	2 vibrating DC motors
•	Colored wires
The circuit should be connected as shown below:
